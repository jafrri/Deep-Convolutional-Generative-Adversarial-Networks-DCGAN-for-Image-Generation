# Deep-Convolutional-Generative-Adversarial-Networks-DCGAN-for-Image-Generation
Implemented Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) for image generation using the Stanford Dogs dataset. The project includes CNN-based discriminator, a transposed convolutional generator, and experimentation with VGG-16 as the discriminator. Achieved realistic dog images through effective GAN training.
